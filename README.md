## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Tasks â€” Core Task Collection

This repository contains implementations and experiments for a series of essential machine learning tasks, organized to reflect theoretical depth and practical application. Each task demonstrates core principles using hands-on Python (NumPy/Scikit-learn) and is structured for both educational exploration and model comparison.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

#### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Overfitting, cross-validation, bootstrap, model selection, regularization, (stochastic) gradient descent
- **Linear Classification (Logistic Regression)**: Feature selection, sparsity, multi-class classification
- **Kernel Methods**: Kernel properties, kernel trick, application to regression/classification, k-NN

#### ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning
- **Neural Networks**: Backpropagation, regularization, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

#### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**: K-means, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Autoencoders**: Neural network-based unsupervised representation learning

#### ðŸ”¹ Bayesian and Probabilistic Modeling
- **Statistical Perspective**: Regularization as prior, loss as likelihood, MAP inference
- **Decision Theory**: Utility-based decision-making and statistical models
- **Bayes Classifiers**: Naive Bayes, Gaussian Bayes, maximum likelihood estimation
- **Bayesian Unsupervised Learning**: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Expectation-Maximization (EM)
